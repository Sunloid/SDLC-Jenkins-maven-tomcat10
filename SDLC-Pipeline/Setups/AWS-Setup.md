AWS EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) is a cloud computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual servers, known 
as instances, to run applications. EC2 enables scalable computing capacity in the cloud, meaning users can launch as many or as few virtual servers as 
needed, depending on demand.
